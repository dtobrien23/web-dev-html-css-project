        <p>My name is Dean O'Brien. I am an emerging web developer and massive Liverpool fan, and what you are looking at is the result of the union of these two apects of my identity. Welcome to Close, but no Quadruple. This is my retrospective of Liverpool Football Club's 2021-22 season, the 130th in their history, and so nearly their greatest. Having prevailed over Chelsea in successive penalty-shootout finals in the FA Cup and League Cup, the Reds were two wins away from capturing an unprecedented four trophies in a single season, before ultimately falling at the final two hurdles to arguably their two greatest foils in the last five seasons - Man City and Real Madrid. Despite missing out on the Premier League and Champions League - the two trophies that matter most of all - almost every Reds fan would agree that the season was still a resounding success, and one that will always be looked back on fondly. And so, with Jurgen Klopp's side sitting in 10th place in the league at time of writing, let us forget about our current woes and take a look back on the season just gone (and pray it wasn't the last such season for some time!) Browse dedicated articles on the league, Europe, the two domestic cups, and a <a href="a1_gallery.html">gallery</a> of some of the most iconic images of the season.
