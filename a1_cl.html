        <p>Liverpool responded to their disappointing quarter final exit to Real Madrid the previous season by resoundingly sweeping aside their opponents in the supposed Group of Death, becoming the first English side to emerge from the group stages of the Champions League with six wins from six. With the four teams of Group B having a combined 15 European Cups in their trophy cabinets, it was the team from Merseyside who showed their quality time and again, with hard-fought wins at home to Milan and away to Atletico coming either side of the annual humiliation of Porto. The Reds then comfortably seen out the second half of the group stage; Porto and Atletico were sent packing from Anfield with 2-0 defeats, while having already won the group a second-string Liverpool team were deployed in Milan, coming home with a 2-1 victory that secured maximum points and sent a message to the rest of Europe that the Reds were still a force to be reckoned with.</p>

        <h2>Knockout Rounds</h2>
        <img class="cl" src="fabinho.jpeg" alt="Fabi">
        <p>Jurgen Klopp's men were rewarded for their group stage dominance with a tricky round of 16 clash with Inter Milan. The champions of Italy were likely the toughest possible draw for the Reds, but a determined and gritty defensive performance and vital goals from Roberto Firmino and Mo Salah on their second trip of the campaign to the San Siro saw advantage handed to Liverpool. A first home loss of the season in the return leg was not enough to knock the Reds out, and they continued on the road to Paris with a quarter final contest with Benfica. Again the first leg was away from home, and again the Reds emerged victorious despite a spirited performance and a goal from future signing Darwin Nunez at the spear of Benfica's attack. Nunez would score again at Anfield, but a second goal of the tie from emerging defensive titan Ibrahima Konate and a brace from Firmino ensured the Reds avoided defeat and marched <img class="cl" src="nunezali.jpeg" alt="Ali">on to the semi finals of Europe's elite competition for the third time under Klopp. Finally the draw was a kind one, with shock semi finalists Villarreal being treated to a last four tie with the Redmen. The home leg was straightforward 2-0 victory, and Reds worldwide could be forgiven for thinking that their team now had a cakewalk to the final. However, Villarreal very nearly landed the same knockout blow to Liverpool that they inflicted on Bayern Munich in the quarter finals, with the hosts levelling the tie in the first-half of the game in Spain. Thankfully, their comeback was ultimately short-lived, as the Reds eventually showed their class and restored their lead both on the night and on aggregate, securing their place in a third Champions League final in five seasons.</p>

        <h2>Final</h2>
        <p class="clfinal">An oft used cliche in football is the phrase 'a game of two halves', and despite its tendency to be proved right time and again, sports writers would usually be keen to avoid throwing this string of characters into their pieces for fear of being labelled unoriginal or lazy. However I must emphasise that the day of the 2022 Champions League Final was a <em>day</em> of two halves. It was a day of two halves for the team in Red. After a season full of backbreaking desire and determination that saw every possible game in all competitions being played, Liverpool found themselves once again in the Champions League final, sharing the stage with fellow European heavyweights and recent rivals Real Madrid. All the hype and excitement and the dreams of what could be leading up to and on the day of the match came crashing down harder than ever as the final whistle sounded around the Stade de France, and Klopp and his boys could only stand and watch as Real reclaimed their European thrown with the acquisition of their 14th European Cup following Vinicius Jr's winner. It was a day of two halves for me and all the fans watching from around the world - <a href="lads.JPG">I made the pilgrimage across the Irish Sea to Merseyside with a group of mates,</a> and to say the atmosphere in the city was otherwordly would still fail to describe the scenes in the pubs and on the streets. We tried to keep our spirits high after the game, but it would be untrue to say the atmosphere was at the same heights as it had been earlier in the day. Most significantly, however, was the day of two halves for the fans who managed to gather the thousands of pounds it costs to attend a game of this magnitude in person. Every football fan is aware of the shocking events outside the stadium prior to kick-off, so I will refrain to go into it in more detail - you can read more into it <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-61633840" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/13/liverpool-fans-unfairly-blamed-for-champions-league-final-chaos-paris-french-senate-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>, and <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-merseyside-63277380" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> if you wish. My takeaway from the evening is that although the defeat was a painful one to swallow, particularly after losing the league by a hair the weekend before, it seems insignificant in the face of what could very easily have become a tragdey outside the stadium. The Reds' trophy parade the following day was a cathartic experience, for those of us watching on the streets and from at home, and especially for those who followed their team back home safely from Paris to their own city.</p>
