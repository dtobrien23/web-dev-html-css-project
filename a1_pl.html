                The Reds picked up where they left off from their resurgent end to the 2020-21 campaign, with four wins from the opening five games. Norwich, Burnely, Leeds, and Palace were dispatched with ease - Liverpool scoring 11 without reply - with a heated 1-1 draw with Chelsea coming between the four wins. Two more draws followed with points dropped at Brentford and at Anfield against Man City, a game which saw Mo Salah continue his phenomenal start to the season with one of the Premier League's great goals. A pair of  remarkable 5-0 away wins were to follow, down at Watford and, famously, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/58943625" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">at Old Trafford</a> in what was one of my most joyous days as a Liverpool supporter. I was brought firmly back down to earth in the following weeks, however, as the Reds rounded out the opening three months of the season with a disappointing 2-2 draw at home to Brighton, in one of a small number of games over the season where it could be argued that Jurgen Klopp's men lost the league title.

                November opened with the first defeat of the season away to West Ham, before a run of six wins on the bounce leading up to Christmas week. Among these was a trademark 94th-minute Divock Origi winner away at Wolves, up there with the most I have ever celebrated a goal. The Reds only claimed 2 points from the next 9 over the notoriously difficult post-Christmas period, with a draw at Spurs, defeat at Leicester, and the second of what would end up being four draws with Chelsea. The final weeks of January were more successful, with two wins to tie up the month. We were also treated to the delight of a new mid-season signing, with Luis Diaz arriving from Porto to much fanfare. The electric Columbian would not disappoint, instantly becoming a new favourite of the Anfield faithful.

            At the beginning of February, few would have wagered that Liverpool would take City down to the final game of the season in the race for the title, such was City's dominance in the league up until that point. Yet, that is just what happened, with Jurgen Klopp's mentality monsters going unbeaten for the rest of the season, winning an astonishing 14 of their last 16. A 6-0 win at home to Leeds and another thrashing of United at Anfield were among the highlights, as well as a colossal clash at the Etihad in which the spoils were shared, and ultimately the advantage was handed to City in the race for the league.2 goals for Villa against City on the final day of the season made us all believe that it was actually going to happen, but a 3-1 win for the Reds was not enough, as City produced a dramatic comeback in the late stages of the game to break our hearts. Liverpool ended another outstanding campaign just one point short of Pep Guardiola's men for the second time in recent seasons. Mo Salah shared the PL Golden Boot with Heung-Min Son as joint top-scorer with 23 goals - as well as claiming the Playmaker award for most assists, while Klopp won the PL Manager of the Year award, despite finishing runner-up to Pep!
