        <h1>League Cup</h1>
        <h4>Record-Breaking Triumph</h4>
        </hgroup>
        
        
        <p>The early rounds of the League Cup were comfortable for Liverpool, with away victories against Norwich and Preston bringing the Reds to their first of three quarter final ties of the season before the new year. Brendan Rodgers' Leicester came to Anfield fighting, with the Foxes racing into a 2-0 lead, and then restoring their two-goal cushion after Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain made it 2-1. It looked as though the Reds were going out as the game headed deep into injury time with the home side trailing 3-2, when up popped forgotten man Takumi Minamino with a last-gasp equaliser to send the Anfield crowd - and me and my family listening on the kitchen radio - ballistic. The Reds prevailed on penalities and proceeded to the semi-finals, where Arsenal awaited. Liverpool had consistently gotten the better of the Gunners in recent seasons, and this tie proved to be no different. Fan favourite Diogo Jota was once again a thorn in Arsenal's side, as he scored twice at the Emirates to set up Liverpool's first of two days at Wembley of 2022. The final against Chelsea was always going to be a battle, and it took penalties to separate the sides following a goalless 120 minutes. Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel turned to his backup goalie Kepa Arrizabalaga to be the difference as he subbed on his penalty expert at the end of extra time for regular shot-stopper Edouard Mendy. It may have been this decision that cost the Blues, as the remarkable shootout that followed seen every outfield player for both sides convert their spot-kicks. Up stepped Liverpool's deputy keeper, Irishman Caoimhin Kelleher, who dispatched his with the coolness of a seasoned penalty taker. It was Kepa's turn, then, to match his opposite number, but Kelleher was not to be undone, and Kepa's spot kick was still soaring through the air as Jordan Henderson performed his trademark shuffle and lifted Liverpool's first League Cup in a decade, and their first trophy of the season.

        <h1>FA Cup</h1>
        <h4>Reds Inflict More Wembley Blues</h4>
        </hgroup>
        
        <p>Like in the League Cup, the first few rounds of the FA Cup proved relatively straightforward for the Reds. Three home victories over Shrewsbury, Cardiff, and Norwich came before a tricky test away to soon-to-be-promoted Nottingham Forest left Liverpool needing a late Diogo Jota winner to send them to the semi-finals. A colossal clash away to Man City was to await, the weekend following the immense 2-2 draw at Anfleid in the league. The world was expecting another heavyweight clash with the two outstanding teams in English football exchanging blows, going toe-to-toe, one of them eventually edging it and emerging victorious. In reality, Guardiola's men were shellshocked by the intensity of their opponents, with the Reds utterly dominating the opening exhanges and racing into a 3-0 lead. The final 3-2 scoreline was not really a true reflection of Liverpool's superiority on the day, but nevertheless, a second Wembley date of the season with Chelsea was their reward. Surprising no one, the final ended once again at 0-0, and another penalty shootout awaited the 22 exhausted men left on the pitch. Kepa was not called upon by his manager on this occassion. The penalites were slightly less vintage than those of February's shootout, with Azpilicueta of Chelsea rattling the post, and Mane of Liverpool firing straight at his compatriot Mendy when he could have won it. Happily, it would still be a day of celebration for Mane and his teammates, and everyone connected with Liverpool, as the Greek Scouser Kostas Tsimikas scored the winning penalty to send the red half of Wembley into hysteria. Henderson soon lifted his and Liverpool's second trophy of the year, in doing so becoming the first Liverpool captain to lift the four major trophies, and making Klopp the first Liverpool manager to achieve the same feat.</p>
